# Clinical Dashboard React Application

This is a React-based Clinical Dashboard application designed to visualize and manage data from clinical studies, including data from wearables, ultrasounds, and images.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login/logout functionality with token-based authentication - (to be implemented).
- **Dynamic Header**: Includes notifications, settings, and user profile actions with a clean and compact design - (to be implemented).
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive plots and information display for clinical data (to be implemented).

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/clinical-dashboard.git
   cd clinical-dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Scripts

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode. The page will auto-reload after changes, and lint errors are displayed in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Refer to the [running tests guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. React will be bundled and optimized for the best performance. The app is then ready to be deployed.

### `npm run eject`
**Note**: Ejecting is a one-way operation. Once ejected, you cannot go back. This exposes the build tools for advanced customization.
